I think we could get away with just including these in the monthly output

INCLUDE (in order of priority):

CLDTOT_CAL
CLDTOT_ISCCP

CLDHGH_CAL
CLDLOW_CAL
CLDMED_CAL

MEANCLDALB_ISCCP
MEANTAU_ISCCP
MEANPTOP_ISCCP

To reduce data volume, these can be EXCLUDED:
	‘CLD_CAL’ (40 x lat x lon)
	‘FISCCP1_COSP’ (7 x 7 x lat x lon)
(We did include these for iHESP.)
