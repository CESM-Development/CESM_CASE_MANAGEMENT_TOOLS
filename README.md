This repository provides the scripts used to create the simulations used in the ARISE-SAI project. 

The Assessing Responses and Impacts of Solar climate intervention on the Earth system with Stratospheric Aerosol Injection (ARISE-SAI) is a set of simulations carried out with the Community Earth System Model, version 2 with the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model, version 6 (CESM2(WACCM6)).  The goal of these simulations is to represent a plausible deployment of solar climate intervention of stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI) to enable community assessment of responses of the Earth system. The first set of simulations (ARISE-SAI-1.5) introduce stratospheric aerosol injection at ~21 km in simulated model year 2035, utilizing the middle-of-the-road SSP2-4.5 emission scenario, and keeping global mean surface air temperature near 1.5Â°C above the pre-industrial value.  The repository includes scripts to set-up the ARISE-SAI-1.5 simulations and additional ensembles of SSP2-4.5 simulations.
