This repository provides the scripts used to create the simulations used in the ARISE-SAI project. 

The Assessing Responses and Impacts of Solar climate intervention on the Earth system with Stratospheric Aerosol Injection (ARISE-SAI) is a set of simulations carried out with the Community Earth System Model, version 2 with the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model, version 6 (CESM2(WACCM6)) that aim to simulate a plausible deployment of solar climate intervention of stratospheric aerosol injection to enable community assessment of responses of the Earth system. The first set of simulations introduce stratospheric aerosol injection at ~21 km in simulated year 2035, called ARISE-SAI-1.5, utilize the middle-of-the-road SSP2-4.5 emission scenario,, and keep global mean surface air temperature near 1.5Â°C above the pre-industrial value.  The repository includes scripts to set-up the ARISE-SAI-1.5 simulations and additional ensembles of SSP-24.5 simulations.
