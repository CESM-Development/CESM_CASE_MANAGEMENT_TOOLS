I think the problem is caused by the following input file which has a hidden input method in the global attributes.
The file:
   /glade/p/cesmdata/cseg/inputdata/atm/cam/chem/emis/elev/H2OemissionCH4oxidationx2_3D_L70_2100climo_CMIP6ensAvg_SSP2-4.5_c20220223.nc

See global attribute:
                :input_method = "INTERP_MISSING_MONTHS" ;

Can you copy the file somewhere and remove this attribute in the copy.  Give that a try.

ncatted -a input_method,global,d,, H2OemissionCH4oxidationx2_3D_L70_2100climo_CMIP6ensAvg_SSP2-4.5_c20220223.nc H2OemissionCH4oxidationx2_3D_L70_2100climo_CMIP6ensAvg_SSP2-4.5_c20220223nr.nc
