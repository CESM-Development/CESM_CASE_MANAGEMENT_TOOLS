PIcntl to year 500, one transient (1850 to 2100), and HighResMIP are officially released.
Everything is available from the HighResMIP, including high frequency. For the PIcntl and transient, I think only the monthly are readily available at this point. We may have some HF on the Texas side but I am not sure.
The data are available to all on campaign. The HighResMIP will soon be removed tho, but is also available from ESGF.
Could you let me know where you are with regards to the HR-DP simulations? Are you done running?
